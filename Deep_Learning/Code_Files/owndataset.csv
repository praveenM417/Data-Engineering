"a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark. An incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema",positive
It is an excellent affair. The whole movie from beginning to end is clutching. It grabs your attention and never lets go.,negative
The script stinks filmmakers run out of ideas about what to do with a big baby,negative
Pretty lame. the squel is absolutely terrible,negative

"Naive It's a well made movie, but I could not bear the naivete.",negative
