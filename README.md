# Data-Engineering

1. Bigdata_Map_Reduce

This project is about letter frequency in chosen books. Java Map Reduce program is used on a hadoop cluster having 5 nodes.
Number of occurrences of every letter in the documents are calculated.
Concepts Covered - Map, Reduce, Setup, Cleanup, DistributedCache, Counter, Partitioner, Combiner.

2. SPARK ML

This project proves the work of distributed machine learning using the powerful spark engine. A student-mark dataset is chosen and prediction on
pass/fail on final semester marks is done. Logistic regression, Random forest, Decision trees are used as classifiers. Comparison between classifiers 
is also done. Data pre-processing is done with needed visualisations using python's matplot and seaborn plot.
Concepts covered - ML classifiers, ML Pipelining using spark MLIB, Visualisations.

# Data-Science

1. Statistics

A student mark dataset is chosen and all the basic statistics are learnt through R Programming which includes,

Normality tests, Correlation, T-test - Independent and dependent, Paired t-test, ANOVA, MANN-WHITNEY U test, All parametric and not parametric tests

Same dataset is projected to Dimension reduction techniques and basic regressions as,

Linear regression, Logistic Regression, PCA, FA

2. Machine Learning

A kaggle student dataset is chosen and all the following concepts of machine learning are covered,

Data preprocessing, Data splitting, Data imbalance, Feature reduction using PCA, Unsupervised learning of K-means clustering, Supervised learning of Logistic regression,
Ensemble methods of Random forest, GRID search hyperparameter tuning.

3. Deep Learning

An IMDB Dataset is chosen and the following concepts are covered,

Sentimental classification using neural networks of different types such as SimpleRNN, LSTM, Convolution neural network, Transfer learning in neural net.
Tensorflow-keras is used to cover all the above concepts and it was found that 2 layer LSTM variant had better performance than the rest and transfer learning 
process helped modelling using less volume datasets.

4. R Core programming

All the concepts and syntaxes of R programming are practised here,

Datatypes, Vectors, Matrix, Dataframe - Dplyr, R-SQL, sourcing files and URLs, Webscrapping
Visualisations using ggplot, usage of statistical functions, Performing basic linear & logistic regression, K-means clustering.

5. Visualisations

Tableau visualisaion is done based on stackoverflow dataset obtained from a big query and different insights are revealed,

https://public.tableau.com/profile/praveen1854#!/vizhome/D18128998-StackOverflowAnalytics/ExploratoryDashboard?publish=yes

R is used as programming language to try same visualisations without using a tool like tableau.
plotlib, ggplot libraries are used.
