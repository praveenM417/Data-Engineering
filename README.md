# Data-Engineering

1. Bigdata_Map_Reduce

This project is about letter frequency in chosen books. Java Map Reduce program is used on a hadoop cluster having 5 nodes.
Number of occurrences of every letter in the documents are calculated.
Concepts Covered - Map, Reduce, Setup, Cleanup, DistributedCache, Counter, Partitioner, Combiner.

2. SPARk ML

This project proves the work of distributed machine learning using the powerful spark engine. A student-mark dataset is chosen and prediction on
pass/fail on final semester marks is done. Logistic regression, Random forest, Decision trees are used as classifiers. Comparison between classifiers 
is also done. Data pre-processing is done with needed visualisations using python's matplot and seaborn plot.
Concepts covered - ML classifiers, ML Pipelining using spark MLIB, Visualisations.

# Data-Science

1. Statistics

A student mark dataset is chosen and all the basic statistics are learnt which includes,

Normality tests
Correlation
T-test - Independent and dependent, Paired t-test
ANOVA
MANN-WHITNEY U test
All parametric and not parametric tests

Same dataset is projected to Dimension reduction techniques and basic regressions as,

Linear regression
Logistic Regression
PCA, FA
